# AppCommandControls
Quick and simple app created so my StreamDeck can send media controls to its computer while full screen RDP is connected. 

## Issue
When I remote into a workstation with all my displays, Windows captures the media keys on the host pc and diverts them to the RDP session. I like to have music playing on the host and wanted a way to quickly issue media keys to it.

## How I Use The App
I use my Stream Deck (connected to host) to launch the app via the ***System -> Open*** command.
```
AppCommandControls.exe play/pause
```
